# Noisy-MNIST-Classifier-using-Deep-Learning
This project showcases the development of a robust classifier using deep learning techniques to accurately classify the Noisy MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to build a neural network model capable of handling noisy and distorted images, making it a valuable tool for tasks where data quality is less than ideal.

Project Description:
This project is on image classification for noisy MNIST dataset. When we add noise to images in the MNIST dataset, the digits in the images become more and more difficult for human to recognize. For example, the images here have increasingly large noise levels. However, interestingly, deep neural networks can still be trained to recognize them relatively well.

Your task is to train a good hand-written-digit recognition classifier for the noisy images. Here are the train_images and train_labels. (You can download them, and then use pickle.load(open(path, 'rb')) to open them. They are both tensorflow tensors.)
